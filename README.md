This repository showcases various C programs I've written while trying to understand Linux and learn systems programming.

kernel_programming is a directory for applications that interface directly with the Linux kernel and rely on system calls. While not yet complete, of particular note is the program shell\_program.c

K&R is a directory for the solutions to some of the exercises in the original C Programming Language (2 ed.) book by K&R. I prefer not to use library functions until I've tried to implement them myself, so you'll find some of those in there as well.
