Various programs I've written in C

kernel_programming is a directory for applications that interface with the Linux kernel. While not yet complete, of particular note is the program shell\_program.c

K&R is a directory for some of the exercises in the origianl C Programming Language (2 ed.) book by K&R. I don't like to use library functions until I've tried implementing them myself, so you'll find other random library implementations in there as well.
