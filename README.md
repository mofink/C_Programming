This repository showcases various C programs I've written while trying to understand Linux and learn systems programming.

kernel_programming is a directory for applications that interface directly with the Linux kernel and rely on system calls. 

c_standard_library is a directory for implementations of the C header files included in the standard library. Much of the code comes from P.J. Plauger's book "The Standard C Library", comments are all my own

K&R is a directory for the solutions to some of the exercises in the original C Programming Language (2 ed.) book by K&R
