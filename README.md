Various programs I've written in C

kernel_programming is a directory for applications that involve systems programming and interface with the Linux kernel. While not yet complete, of particular note is the program shell\_program.c

K&R is a directory for some of the exercises in the origianl C Programming Language (2 ed.) book by K&R. I prefer not to use library functions until I've tried implemented them myself, so you'll find some of those in there as well.
