I've found that I learn best by digging down into first principles. This repository showcases various C programs I've written while trying to understand Unix and systems programming.

kernel_programming is a directory for applications that involve systems programming and interface directly with the Linux kernel. While not yet complete, of particular note is the program shell\_program.c

K&R is a directory for the solutions to some of the exercises in the original C Programming Language (2 ed.) book by K&R. I prefer not to use library functions until I've tried to implement them myself, so you'll find some of those in there as well.
